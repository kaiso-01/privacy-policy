        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how <strong>My Tasks Reminder</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") treats personal information in connection with our mobile application ("App").</p>

        <div class="important-summary">
            <p><strong>Important summary:</strong> My Tasks Reminder stores all task-related data locally on the user's device and does not collect, transmit, or share personal information to any servers controlled by us or third parties by default. All data remains on the user's phone unless the user chooses to export or sync it to their own cloud storage (for example, Google Drive, iCloud, or other personal cloud accounts). Any cloud backup or sync feature uses the user's selected cloud account and will require explicit consent and authorization; the app developer does not host or access your task data on our own servers.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how the app handles data. This Policy applies to all users of the My Tasks Reminder app.</p>

        <h2 id="what-information">What Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> We do not collect or transmit personal information by default.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All task data (titles, descriptions, due dates/times, priorities, tags, and subtasks) is stored locally on your device only.</li>
            <li>The app does not send your tasks or personal information to our servers or to any third parties unless you explicitly enable and authorize an optional cloud backup/sync feature (for example, Google Drive). If you enable Google Drive sync, the app will request permission via OAuth and may access your Drive to create and manage a backup file. We only access the files and metadata necessary to manage backups.</li>
            <li>We do not collect analytics, device identifiers, or usage telemetry by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you enable Google Sign-In (optional), we may request access to basic profile information (such as your email address) to associate backups with your account; this is optional and requested only with your consent.</p>
        <p>If you believe any behavior contradicts this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:isslamkais40@gmail.com">isslamkais40@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="how-collect">How We Collect Information</h2>
        <p>By default, My Tasks Reminder does not collect information. All data you create in the app is saved locally on your device. There is no automatic sending of task data to external servers.</p>
        <p>If we add an optional cloud-sync or backup feature in the future, it will be explicitly described in the app and will require your opt-in consent before any data leaves your device.</p>

        <h2 id="why-process">Why We Process Any Data</h2>
        <p>Because My Tasks Reminder stores data locally and does not collect personal information by default, the primary reason any data is processed is to provide the core functionality of the app on your device (creating, storing, and reminding about tasks).</p>
        <p>If you opt-in to a cloud backup feature in the future, the purpose and legal basis for that processing will be made clear before you enable it.</p>

        <h2 id="how-use">How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating, storing, and managing your tasks and reminders</li>
            <li>Sending you scheduled notifications for your tasks</li>
            <li>Syncing your data across devices (if you enable this feature)</li>
            <li>Displaying your tasks organized by date, priority, tags, and categories</li>
            <li>Analyzing app performance to fix bugs and improve features</li>
            <li>Providing customer support when you contact us</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We do NOT:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell your personal information to third parties</li>
            <li>Use your task data for advertising purposes</li>
            <li>Share your information with third parties for their marketing purposes</li>
            <li>Access your task content unless you explicitly request support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>By default, all your task data is stored locally on your device using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Storage:</strong> We use platform-provided secure storage mechanisms</li>
            <li><strong>SQLite Database:</strong> Task data is stored in an encrypted local database</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Key Storage:</strong> Authentication credentials are stored using platform keychain/keystore</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cloud Storage (Optional)</h3>
        <p>If you enable cloud backup or sync, the data will be stored in the cloud storage account you choose (for example, your Google Drive account). Important points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You explicitly authorize the app to access your chosen cloud account when enabling sync/backup (we use OAuth for Google Drive access).</li>
            <li>The app stores an encrypted backup file in your cloud account; the file is created and managed within your Drive and is accessible only by you and any apps you authorize.</li>
            <li>The app does not upload data to servers owned or controlled by the app developer. We do not view or access your task data on our own servers.</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols (HTTPS/TLS). Depending on your device settings, the data stored in your cloud account may be encrypted by the cloud provider.</li>
            <li>Only you (with access to your cloud account) can access or decrypt your cloud-stored data. You may revoke the app's access to your cloud account at any time via your cloud provider's account settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security Measures</h3>
        <p>We implement security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit</li>
            <li>Secure authentication mechanisms</li>
            <li>Regular security updates and patches</li>
            <li>Access controls and monitoring</li>
            <li>Compliance with mobile platform security guidelines</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> While we implement robust security measures, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2 id="share-info">Do We Share Your Information</h2>

        <h3>We Do NOT Sell Your Data</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h3>Limited Sharing Scenarios</h3>
        <p>We may share your information only in these limited circumstances:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> When you explicitly authorize us to share specific information</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted third-party service providers who help us operate the app (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics) under strict confidentiality agreements</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or government request</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfer:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (users will be notified)</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> To protect our rights, property, safety, or that of our users</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="third-party">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses the following third-party services when you enable optional features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Drive (Cloud Backup/Sync):</strong> If you enable sync, the app will ask for your permission to access your Google Drive using OAuth. We store an encrypted backup file in your Drive. The app only accesses files and metadata necessary to manage your backups. For details on how Google handles data, see: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In (Optional):</strong> If used to simplify authentication, we may request basic profile information such as your email address to map backups to your account. This is only requested with your explicit consent and is used solely to associate your backups with your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>OAuth scopes requested (exact):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code> — The app requests this scope to create and manage backup files that the app creates in your Google Drive. This is the only Drive-related OAuth scope requested by the app for backup/sync.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note on Google Sign-In:</strong> the app uses the Google Sign-In flow to obtain user consent for Drive access. No OpenID Connect scopes (such as <code>openid</code>, <code>email</code>, or <code>profile</code>) are explicitly requested by the app in code; only the Drive scope above is requested. The Google Sign-In plugin may return basic account information (email, display name) after a successful sign-in which the app uses to identify the backup owner.</p>
        <p>These integrations operate with the cloud account you provide; the developer does not host or access your task data on our own servers. We will always ask for your consent before enabling any integration and will list the provider and required permissions in-app.</p>

        <h2 id="data-rights">Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>

            <li>Your account and all associated data</li>
            <li>App data from your device (via device settings)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="children">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>My Tasks Reminder is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children</li>
            <li>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us immediately</li>
            <li>We will promptly delete any information we discover has been collected from a child</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Parental Control:</strong> If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, contact us at <a href="mailto:isslamkais40@gmail.com">isslamkais40@gmail.com</a>, and we will take immediate steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2 id="international">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> We do not operate servers that receive or process your task data. By default, your data remains on your device in Algeria or wherever you use the app.</p>
        <p>If you choose to back up or sync your data to a cloud provider, for example Google Drive, that backup file is stored in your cloud account and will be processed by the cloud provider according to their terms and policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> When you enable Google Drive sync the app will request your explicit consent via Google's OAuth flow and will create/manage an encrypted backup file in your Drive. Google may store and process that file in locations outside Algeria (or outside your current country) in accordance with Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Other cloud providers:</strong> Your chosen provider may likewise transfer or process data in other jurisdictions according to its own policies and legal frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important details:</strong></p>
